                        <p>
                            We were tasked to create three book covers based on the podcasts we've chosen from a list. I've chosen Phoebe Judge. Each podcasts found within the Phoebe Judge episodes deals with alot of mysteries and horrors which I tend to enjoy.

It took time to figure out what the book cover of each story should look like.

                            The purpose of this project is to listen to each podcast and to design a cover that represents the storyline. We needed to experiment with different mediums. I experimented with digital and traditional art.

                            <p>
                                I was able to create one book cover for podcast and then I was able to create two more throughout the design process. 
                                There were mutiple sketches but many of them did not fit the storyline. Eventually, I found the solution and I discovered the right "face" of the "Call Your Mom" podcast. The experience of the this design process has taught me how to be able to execute specific deliverables. Since I chose Criminal podcasts, my book covers a lot more dark and grim horror-like stories.
